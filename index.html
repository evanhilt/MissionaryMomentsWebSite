    <h2>About the App</h2>
    <p>This app is inteded to give members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints
        a starting point for member-missionary work. It acts as a Customer Relationship Management
        (CRM) application but instead of having customers, user's have 'Friends' with whom they share
        the restored gospel at 'Events'. Events symbolize past missionary moments with a friend.
        The various categories of events should help foster ideas of how Latter-Day Saints can share 
        the restored gospel with anyone they know.
